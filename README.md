# IA 626 Final Project
#My plan for my final project is to take a dataset from cityofnewyork about arrests in NYC and another dataset from cityofnewyork that contains Covid cases and information
#I plan on taking the two data sets and connecting them in some way im thinking of grouping the daily arrests and then counting each group and then joining the total daily count 
#to the total daily positive cases and making a subset from that to see if the number of covid cases or start of covid had an impact on daily crime in NYC.
